## SELF INTRO
Hi everyone,<br>
My name is Hrishikesh S Namputiri currently persuing as a student of S1 Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I love programming because of the satisfaction when you get your code to work and the thrill to know what go wrong if it didn't and rectify it. What drives me most is the curiosity to know how everything works and to experiment different things.
